# Stat230 project

## Overview
In groups of two or three students, you will conduct a statistical analysis on a data set to
address a research question of your choice. Group choice will be up to you. This task will
require you to write a project proposal, acquire and analyze relevant data, then present your
results orally to the class, and hand in a written report / technical appendix describing your
study and its findings. Successful projects will involve raw datasets containing multiple categorical/quantitative
variables and will (1) include applications of more than one technique
learned in the class and (2) include at least one randomization-based technique learned in
the class (for examples see sections 4.5 and 4.6).
